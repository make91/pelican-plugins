Latex Plugin For Pelican
========================

This plugin allows you to write mathematical equations in your articles using Latex and MathMl.
It uses the MathJax Latex JavaScript library to render *Latex* and *MathMl* that is embedded in
your site.

### Latex
Anything between `$..$` (inline math) and `$$..$$` (displayed math) will be recognized as
Latex. In addition, anything between between `\begin` and `\end` macros will also be 
recognized as Latex. For example, `\begin{equation}`...`\end{equation}` would be used to 
render math equations with numbering.

Within recognized Latex as described above, Latex macros can be used.

### MathMl
Anything between `<math>` and `</math>` tags will be recognized as *MathMl*.

Installation
------------
To enable, ensure that `latex.py` is put somewhere that is accessible.
Then use as follows by adding the following to your settings.py:

    PLUGINS = ["latex"]

Your site is now capable of rendering math math using the mathjax JavaScript
library. No alterations to the template file is needed.

### Typogrify
Typogrify will now play nicely with Latex (i.e. typogrify can be enabled
and Latex will be rendered correctly). In order for this to happen,
version 2.07 (or above) of typogrify is required. In fact, this plugin expects
that at least version 2.07 is present and will fail without it.

### Summaries
Summaries that contain math are processed to ensure that math is not off. If
math is cut off, it will add it back into the summary.

### Templates
No alteration is needed to a template for this plugin to work. Just install
the plugin and start writing your Math.

### TeXReader

This plugin also installs the `TeXReader` which can read most (La)TeX files
with a file extension `*.tex`. It uses a real (la)tex compiler under the hood,
so it is as fast as the compiler is. On the other hand, it is able to process
almost any macro, e.g. `\input{}`, `\ref{}`, etc. The reader requires the 
[tex4ht converter suite](http://www.tug.org/tex4ht/) installed and the 
`mk4ht` program must be in `PATH`.

Usage
-----
### Backward Compatibility
This plugin is backward compatible in the sense that it
will render previous setups correctly. This is because those
settings and metadata information is ignored by this version. Therefore
you can remove them to neaten up your site

### Settings File
Extra options regarding how mathjax renders math can be set in the settings
file. These options are in a dictionary variable called `LATEX` in the pelican
settings file.

The dictionary can be set with the following keys:

 * `wrap`: controls the tags that math is wrapped with inside the resulting
html. For example, setting `wrap` to `'mathjax'` would wrap all math inside
`<mathjax>...</mathjax>` tags. If typogrify is set to True, then math needs
to be wrapped in tags and `wrap` will therefore default to `mathjax` if not
set. `wrap` cannot be set to `'math'` because this tag is reserved for 
mathml notation
 * `align`: controls how displayed math will be aligned. Can be set to either
`left`, `right` or `center` (default is `center`).
 * `indent`: if `align` not set to `center`, then this controls the indent
level (default is `0em`).
 * `show_menu`: controls whether the mathjax contextual menu is shown.
 * `process_escapes`: controls whether mathjax processes escape sequences.
 * `preview`: controls the preview message users are seen while mathjax is
loading.
 * `color`: controls the color of the mathjax rendered font.

For example, in settings.py, the following would make math render in blue and
displaymath align to the left:

    LATEX = {'color':'blue','align':left}

### TeXReader usage

#### Metadata in (La)TeX files

Arbitrary metadata can be specified in comments in this form, one per line

    %metadata tags: awesome,fun
    %metadata lang: en
    %metadata category: math

Additionally, the information defined by the standard macros

    \title{}
    \author{}
    \date{}

is also used as metadata.

#### Tex4ht configuration

The `TeXReader` uses the `tex4ht` suite to compile (La)TeX into HTML files.
You can configure arguments to the `mk4ht` command using config variables used
in the `TeXReader.__init__` method. Alter them only if you know what you are doing!

Latex Examples
--------------
###Inline
Latex between `$`..`$`, for example, `$`x^2`$`, will be rendered inline
with respect to the current html block.

###Displayed Math
Latex between `$$`..`$$`, for example, `$$`x^2`$$`, will be rendered centered in a
new paragraph.

###Equations
Latex between `\begin` and `\end`, for example, `begin{equation}` x^2 `\end{equation}`,
will be rendered centered in a new paragraph with a right justified equation number
at the top of the paragraph. This equation number can be referenced in the document.
To do this, use a `label` inside of the equation format and then refer to that label
using `ref`. For example: `begin{equation}` `\label{eq}` X^2 `\end{equation}`. Now
refer to that equation number by `$`\ref{eq}`$`.
