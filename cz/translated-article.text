A translated article
--------------------
:date: 2014-02-02
:lang: en
:slug: translated-article
:tags: example

This article has a translation, the translation link will take you to it.

Notice that the translation can have a different tag, so even tags can be translated.

As described in the `Pelican translations documentation <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/getting_started.html#translations>`_, an article is considered a translation of a different article if 

1. it has the same ``slug`` metadata
2. has a different ``lang`` metadata

If you want the translation to have a different filename and url than the slug in the original language, use the ``save_as`` and ``url`` metadata as this translation link shows.
